New York (CNN Business)Payless ShoeSource is heading back into bankruptcy. This time it will close its doors.,CNN,19-Feb
"The 63-year old discount shoe retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, less than two years after it emerged from its previous bankruptcy.",CNN,19-Feb
"The bankruptcy filing Monday follows the start of going-out-of-business sales Sunday at its 2,500 US and Canadian stores. About 16,000 employees will lose their jobs. Store closings begin in March and should conclude by the end of May.",CNN,19-Feb
"Payless is the most recent retailer to file for what has become known as ""Chapter 22,"" in which a company emerges from Chapter 11 only to file for bankruptcy a second time and shut down its business.",CNN,19-Feb
"RadioShack, American Apparel and Gymboree all suffered that fate.",CNN,19-Feb
"It's one of the reasons Sears may struggle to remain in business long term, despite the company's promises that it will be a profitable and competitive retailer once again as it emerges from bankruptcy.",CNN,19-Feb
"""The plans always make sense on paper. But the reality is if there are a fundamental problems with the way a customer perceives a retailer, bankruptcy doesn't solve that,"" said Philip Emma, a senior analyst with DebtWire and an expert on retail bankruptcies. ""The is very little margin for error for these companies that try to make it.""",CNN,19-Feb
"Payless had too much debt, too many stores, and too much corporate overhead when it emerged from the earlier bankruptcy, according to Stephen Marotta, who was named last month as the company's chief restructuring officer to prepare for the bankruptcy.",CNN,19-Feb
"Payless also ran into a series of problems that derailed its plans. A computer system issue hurt its back-to-school sales last year, and it carried too much inventory for the holiday season, which forced it to cut prices. Payless' North American business lost $63 million 2018.",CNN,19-Feb
"The company says it owes $1.3 million in severance payments to employees that were laid off before the filing, but it is not sure whether it will be able to make those payments. Nor is it clear that it will be able to pay severance to the employees who lose their jobs going forward as the stores shut down. In the US bankruptcy cases, creditors are paid before employees that are owed severance.",CNN,19-Feb
"Payless will keep open 420 stores in 20 other countries, primarily in Latin America, as well as its stores in US Virgin Islands, Guam and Saipan. But it's core North American business will close.",CNN,19-Feb
Low unemployment should help,CNN,19-Feb
"The good news for Payless employees is the US unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and retailers are having a particularly tough time finding workers. There are more job openings than than candidates.",CNN,19-Feb
"Just 4.3% of job seekers that identify as wholesale and retail workers couldn't find a joblast year, according to the Labor Department. That matches the lowest retail and wholesale unemployment rate on record, which was set in 2000, the year that the government started calculating those industry-specific rates.",CNN,19-Feb
"That low rate comes even as more consumers are shifting from buying goods at brick-and-mortar stores to making purchases online. More than 5,500 US stores closed last year according to Coresight Research, a retail think tank.",CNN,19-Feb
"Although the number of jobs in traditional retail has fallen, the number of people who want to work in the industry has fallen even faster. That tight retail labor market has led some companies to increase incentives.",CNN,19-Feb
"Walmart, (WMT) the largest US business employer with more than 1.5 million US employees, now offers bonuses to employees with a good attendance records. Retailers are also raising their hourly wages to try to attract workers. Target (TGT) will be paying a minimum of $15 an hour by next year.",CNN,19-Feb
"""Retailers are starved for talent at all levels,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner for the retail practice of consultant A.T. Kearney. ""It's a healthy market to be walking into.

"Just a year and a half after exiting bankruptcy with high hopes for a comeback, discount shoe giant Payless ShoeSource is calling it quits. The struggling retailer announced last week that it will close all of its more than 2,000 remaining company-owned stores in the U.S. over the next few months.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
The impending disappearance of Payless ShoeSource from the U.S. retail landscape represents an opportunity for rivals to snap up its customers. The two biggest winners are likely to be DSW (NYSE:DSW) and Caleres(NYSE:CAL).,Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Payless has struggled, but it's still a big name in shoes",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Two years ago, Payless blamed its initial bankruptcy filing in large part on outdated inventory management systems. The company purchased too much merchandise in early 2015 -- much of which arrived late, due to a West Coast port strike.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"The resulting inventory glut forced Payless to take huge markdowns, wrecking its margins. Meanwhile, a heavy debt load left it with little room to maneuver. However, the company was able to shed much of its debt during its 2017 restructuring, and planned to update its inventory management systems after emerging from bankruptcy.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Unfortunately, Payless' problems ran a little deeper than inventory management problems. For one thing, the footwear market is highly fragmented and extremely competitive. Additionally, mall traffic has been falling for years, weighing on in-store sales. Payless' bankruptcy restructuring bought it some time, but not enough time to address these thorny issues.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Still, Payless had around $2.3 billion of revenue in 2016 and kept most of its stores open after its original bankruptcy filing. Thus, there's a substantial revenue opportunity for rivals to fight over.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
DSW is making the right moves,Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Resurgent off-price shoe giant DSW has a chance to take a sizable chunk of Payless' business. DSW itself was struggling with sluggish sales a couple of years ago, but it returned to comp sales growth in 2017 and its growth rate accelerated in 2018.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, DSW's core U.S. retail segment -- which consists of more than 500 DSW stores -- posted a strong 7.3% comp sales increase and grew total sales 10% year over year. Adjusted earnings soared more than 50% and DSW raised its full-year earnings per share guidance. Analysts expect another year of double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal 2019.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"DSW's self-service, off-price business model should appeal to bargain-hunting Payless customers. Moreover, DSW is addressing its biggest historical weakness: the lack of a robust kids' offering. The company introduced children's sections into nearly half of its stores several years ago and has been expanding that business aggressively. This will help it target young parents, a key demographic for Payless ShoeSource.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"DSW is on track to end fiscal 2018 with a little over $3 billion in annual revenue, so it is still small enough that taking a significant chunk of Payless' market share could have a meaningful impact on its revenue and earnings growth.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
The parent of Famous Footwear could also profit,Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Caleres is also well positioned to benefit from Payless' demise. While the company makes shoes under a number of midrange-to-upscale brands, including Naturalizer and Allen Edmonds, it generates the majority of its revenue -- $1.6 billion out of a total of $2.8 billion in fiscal 2017 -- from its Famous Footwear chain.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"Famous Footwear has more of a focus on name-brand athletic shoes than Payless (or DSW, for that matter), but it still has plenty of overlap with Payless in terms of styles and price points. It has an even broader store footprint than DSW, with roughly 1,000 U.S. locations. It also already has a robust kids' offering: Caleres gets about 9% of its revenue from children's shoes, and that percentage is probably significantly higher for the Famous Footwear chain itself.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"While Famous Footwear doesn't have quite the same sales momentum as DSW, it was on track to post low-single-digit comp sales growth in fiscal 2018 as of last November. And after closing some underperforming locations last year, it has a more productive store base.",Motley Fool,19-Feb
"DSW and Caleres' Famous Footwear chain will be just two of many chains looking to gain market share as the last Payless ShoeSource stores close a few months from now. But their common focus on selling discounted shoes in a self-serve ""open-sell"" format should make DSW and Famous Footwear go-to shoe stores for many former Payless customers.",Motley Fool,19-Feb

The Company expects that Payless store closings will begin at the end of March and many stores will remain open through the end of May, as it conducts liquidation sales in the U.S. and Canada. Payless has also wound down its e-commerce operations.",Business Wire,19-Feb
"Payless’ retail operations outside of North America, including its company-owned stores in Latin America, are separate legal entities and are not included in the Chapter 11 or CCAA filings. Payless’ 420 stores across 20 countries in Latin America, its stores in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Saipan, and its 370 international franchisee stores in 16 countries across the Middle East, India, Indonesia, Indochina, Philippines and Africa, will continue operating business as usual in every respect.",Business Wire,19-Feb
"Stephen Marotta, appointed in January 2019 to serve as Chief Restructuring Officer of Payless, said, ""We have worked diligently with our suppliers and other partners to best position Payless for the future amidst significant structural, operational, and market challenges. Despite these efforts, we now must wind down our North American retail operations under Chapter 11 and the CCAA. However, Payless’ profitable stores throughout Latin America, which are not part of today’s filing, and our international franchisees’ stores will continue to operate business as usual in every respect. As we move through the process, we will work to minimize the impact on our employees, customers, vendors and other stakeholders.",Business Wire,19-Feb
"“The challenges facing retailers today are well documented, and unfortunately Payless emerged from its prior reorganization ill-equipped to survive in today’s retail environment. The prior proceedings left the Company with too much remaining debt, too large a store footprint and a yet-to-be realized systems and corporate overhead structure consolidation. As a consequence, despite our substantial efforts, we were ultimately unable to operate the North American retail and e-commerce operations on a sustainable basis.”",Business Wire,19-Feb
"Mr. Marotta continued, ""On behalf of the entire company, I’d like to express our deep appreciation for the hard work of our dedicated employees and their commitment to Payless customers, who have shown us tremendous loyalty for more than 60 years. We are also grateful for the many years of support by our suppliers and vendors, and we look forward to continuing to work with them to support our remaining operations.""",Business Wire,19-Feb

"Payless is seeking customary initial relief from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Canadian Court, including authorization to support its operations during the process, authorization to continue payment of employee wages and maintain healthcare benefits and certain other relief customary in these circumstances.
